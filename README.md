## Problem

Finding and selecting suitable wedding vendors, while navigating a sea of options and pricing uncertainties, is a time-consuming and stressful challenge for engaged couples. 

## Why Does My Solution Need to Exist in the World?

Our project aims to simplify the wedding planning process by offering a centralized platform for discovering, evaluating, and booking vendors.
It exists to alleviate the stress and frustration couples experience during wedding planning, providing transparency, ease of use, and confidence in vendor selection.

## Pain Points

* Vendor Overload - Couples are overwhelmed with options when searching for wedding vendors 
* Price Uncertainty - Determining vendor prices is often unclear and challenging 
* Visual Clarity - Couples want to see examples of vendor work to ensure alignment with their vision 
* Reliability - Selecting vendors without sufficient reviews can be risky 
* Lack of advanced search filters that allow couples to narrow down their choices based on specific criteria such as location, services, style, and budget.

## How Will Our UI Solve the Identified Problem

* An intuitive and user-friendly interface will allow couples to easily browse and compare vendors, helping them find the perfect match quickly 
* Including vendor starting prices in the interface provides transparency and helps couples budget effectively. 
* The UI will showcase vendor portfolios with high-quality images and videos, allowing couples to assess the vendor's work and style 
* Reviews and ratings prominently displayed in the UI will help couples gauge a vendor's reliability and reputation 
* Lack of advanced search filters that allow couples to narrow down their choices based on specific criteria such as location, services, style, and budget.
* Create curated collections of vendors based on popular themes, styles, or budget ranges. This can simplify decision-making by presenting couples with a pre-selected list of vendors that match their preferences.
ï»¿* Encourage vendors to offer package options that bundle services together
